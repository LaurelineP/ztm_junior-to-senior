# Learn About Code Splitting & Performance
*( August 2023 )*
This project being part of the course, was made coding along
and may vary from the videos.

## Step 1: coding along
*Note: This would be the base on which we would iterate*
- create a project with CRA ( despite its deprecations )
- compose your app: an app that has in its content inner tabs
	- has 3 tabs
	- if a tab is clicked you shall display the content
	 for this clicked tab



## Step 2: Exercise - Code Splitting exercise - app initial version:
Once the App code is set, observe what a build ( compilation of the 
code for the production ) will do. Follow the following test to create a build
- run `npm run build`
- observe what changes the project had
- change some bit of code or add a component 
- run `npm run build` again
- answer the following: what did happen ? what can we observe 

### Answer/Observations
- a `build/` folder has been generated with a js and html files, a new folder static
- each time we run the command: a new build is generated then injected to the 
script tag

## Step 3: Exercise - Code Splitting exercise - app modified version:
With dynamic imports we can avoid the browser to load all at once
which will improve performances and the time to first byte  ( TTFB )

There are two ways to split the code
- route based splitting: splitting occurring for each page load
- component splitting: splitting based on component 
Ex: when there is a big component that does not need to load all the component  
as they may not be required right away.

### Approach here
The way the app requires the dynamic splitting here is  
based on a condition expecting to have an array of tabs.
This condition emulates the tabs to be loaded asynchronously:
- rendering: if `tabs` exist, the `NavigationTab` and `Page`   
- implementation: through a useEffect triggered after 5 second  
( see `useEffect` )

This implementation allows to distinctly see in the browser's   
inspector network tab 
- loads first the bundle
- then 5 sec later, it loads the 2 others files ( corresponding  
to the dynamically imported components )

### Problematic encounter / Motivation
Following the reusability principle for a component:
- This personal implementation did use the same   
component `Page` and the composition pattern to inherit   
from whatever children and did not want to duplicate the   
3 condition rendering a Page - Hence the approach of fake 
asynchronous load ( alike a fetch )
```jsx
/**
 * ‚ùå (unfitted for this implementation ==> unnecessary repetition )  
 * course code logic applied: this would resemble to the following
 * - unfit because Page as already been imported --> hence no need
 */
 
	if( selectedTab === 'tab1') return <Page>{ selectedTab }</Page>
	else if ( selectedTab ) return <Page>{ selectedTab }</Page>
	else { <Page>{ selectedTab }</Page> }


// course approach applied
	if( selectedTab === 'tab1') { return <Page1> }
	else if ( selectedTab === 'tab2') { 
		this.setState({ component: import('./Page1') })
	} else if{ <Page>{ selectedTab }</Page> }
```

### Code Splitting - 2 Different ways
They are different ways to aboard code splitting:
- route-based code splitting: will split on page request
- component-based code splitting: to split unused component  
in the render ( ex bugger button > on click will display  
another component ).

### Another way to implement the code splitting
Doing component based code splitting, we could implement  
it using tools such as `react-loadable`.
The implementation is quite similar to `React.lazy`  
but still different

- [`react-loadable` library](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable) 
*(‚ú®smooth documentation and explanations ‚ú®üëå)*
- [Loadable VS React.lazy article](https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/loadable-components/docs/loadable-vs-react-lazy/)
```jsx
// React Loadable implementation
import Loadable from 'react-loadable';

const LoadableBar = Loadable({
  loader: () => import('./components/Bar'),
  loading() {
    return <div>Loading...</div>
  }
});
```



## Step 4: Exercise - Code Splitting exercise - dynamic import and React Lazy:

`React.lazy`: lets render dynamic import as default component  
by deferring its load in the DOM.
`React.lazy` is always working in combination with `Suspense` in  
order to be consumed within the JSX.  

`Suspense` allows the react deferring to acknowledge the DOM's  
diff that can occur.


```jsx
// Abstracting the explanation
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';


// custom function handling "default" and "non-default" exported 
// components as by default, React.lazy loads default exports
const loadAsDefault = module => ({ default: Object.values(module)[0] || module.default });


// use React.lazy - outside/above of the component definition 
const ComponentA = lazy(() => import('<ComponentA-PATH>').then(loadAsDefault));
const ComponentB = lazy(() => import('<ComponentB-PATH>').then(loadAsDefault));


// ‚û°Ô∏è then use the components within the component definition using the Suspense
const ComponentRoot = () => {
	return ( 
		<>
			<h1>Component Root</h1>
			<Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading...</h1>}>
				<ComponentA />
				<ComponentB />
			</Suspense>
		<>
	)
}

```

# Performance and code optimizations
*This project is a reused one : robot friend aka personas*  
*friend on which we will analyze and apply optimizations*

## Analyze React application's performance
This could be done using:
- **inspector > Performances Tab** 
the browser **inspector > Performances Tab** then record some UX  
 	- this could be enhance by the hack of adding `?react_perf` in the URL
	`localhost:3000/?react_perf` displaying component names
- [**React devtools** ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
leverage the [**react devtools**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) component to debug in details
	- **Browser Inspector > Profiler** (enabled by the extension react devtool)
- **React API**  
React API provides element to control more the rendering process  
( such as `shouldComponentUpdate` for class-based component,  
`React.memo` for hook-based component )
- **External package**: [why-did-you-render](https://vasanthk.gitbooks.io/react-bits/content/patterns/19.async-nature-of-setState.html)
- **Redux leverage**
Based on the component re-rendering, we can check what parent component  
renders what in order to optimize in an intelligent what the request made  
against the redux store

### React lifecycle / control 
- `shouldComponentUpdate(prevState, nextState)`:
**In class based-component**, when you need to limit the   
updates/re-rendering we could use `shouldComponentUpdate` within   
the rerendering component *( maybe after a refacto into a component )*   
we can use this to control its render
This lifeCycle is happening **before the render**.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-off to be aware of**:  
Adding this also adds more code to process --> hence  
this also implies a loss of performance --> üìù Do not over use it!
```jsx
shouldComponentUpdate(prevState, nextState){
	// will update if return true and will not if returned false;

}
```

## Review for performances optimizations
- Only load what is needed
	- code splitting 
	- [tree shaking](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-javascript/tree-shaking/): the bundlers feature analyzing what the project use and drop unnecessary imports - do not rely on this only as it can still load  
	uncaught imports
- Avoid to block the JS main thread with heavy loads
( minimizing code, content, resources, compilations,   
parsing, execution to be aware of)
- Avoid Memory Leaks:
Keep in mind to remove unnecessary timing functions for instance
- Avoid Multiple Re-rendering: minimizing the DOM manipulations
